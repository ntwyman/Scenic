# Scenic

This is a SwiftUI/SceneKit app for modelling the evolution of a crudely modelled grid of springs. I started it to:
* Have a visualization for a model I am thinking about for a lightbox I am going to build (TODO: Add link to that repo)
* Play around with current Mac desktop development
* Which led me to learning about SceneKit and realizing that it is not particularly current (but is kinda cool).
